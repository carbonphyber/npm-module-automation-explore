# NPM Module Automation Explore
A test repo to explore maximum CICD and GitHub automation for a JavaScript NPM repo. This repo aims to streamline enforcement of reporting issues; managing code submissions (PRs); maintaining code style, quality, and security; and with the potential to be used as a template for other GitHub-based JavaScript/NPM projects.
